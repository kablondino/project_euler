    Problem 6: Sum square difference

    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
        1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
    natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
    hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
=#

sum_of_squares, square_of_sum = 0, 0

for i = 1:100
	global sum_of_squares += i^2
	global square_of_sum += i
end

square_of_sum = square_of_sum^2

println("Sum of squares: $sum_of_squares, Square of sum: $square_of_sum, "
		*"Difference: $(square_of_sum - sum_of_squares)")
