This repository contains the source code to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/ "Project Euler") problems in various languages.
Currently, it includes Python, C, Fortran 95, Go, and Matlab/Octave.
All of the solutions will be attempted without use of proprietary functions, *i.e.* no built-in Matlab functions that aren't in Octave.
